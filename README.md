# TIP-CALCULATOR
TIP CALCULATOR
The Tip Calculator is a simple Python-based program that helps users calculate the amount each person should pay when splitting a bill and adding a tip. It allows you to input the total bill, select a percentage for the tip (e.g., 10%, 12%, 15%), and specify how many people are sharing the bill. The program then calculates and displays the amount each person should pay.

How the Game Works:
1.The program asks for the total bill amount.
2.The user is prompted to input the tip percentage they want to give (10%, 12%, or 15%).
3.The number of people splitting the bill is entered.
4.The program calculates the total amount per person, including the tip, and outputs the final amount each person should pay.

FEATURES:
-Bill Input: Accepts the total bill amount.
-Tip Percentage: Allows the user to choose a tip percentage from 10%, 12%, or 15%.
-People Split: Allows the user to specify how many people the bill should be split among.
-Final Amount Calculation: Calculates the total amount including the tip, then divides it equally among the specified number of people.
-Rounded Amount: Outputs the final amount to be paid per person, rounded to two decimal places for accuracy.
